• **Problem Classification & Workflow**

1. **Each Day folder contains**:
      o	notes.md → problem restatement, constraints, intuition, brute/optimized approaches, patterns, key insights
      o	solution.cpp → production-level, readable, optimized C++ code
2. **Daily workflow**:
      o	Solve problem
      o	Write notes.md
      o	Save & commit solution.cpp
      o	Push to GitHub → Daily contributions track
3. **Patterns & Algorithms Covered**
      o	Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Hashing, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Recursion, etc.
      o	Each problem maps to one or multiple patterns for faster interview recall

• **Usage Guidelines**

Review notes.md for patterns & intuition before coding
Follow consistent folder + file naming convention for each new problem
Use this repo as a daily practice tracker and interview prep resource


• **Contribution & Open Source**

Public repository → all commits reflect your daily coding activity
Encourage forking & collaboration for learning best practices
This repo doubles as a portfolio for FAANG/MIT-level interviews
